Dependency Inversion Principle 

Imagine you have a car that depends on a specific engine to function. If this car is designed to work only with that engine, then if you want to switch to a different engine, you'll have to make many changes to the car. This can be complicated and time-consuming.

The Dependency Inversion Principle suggests that you should avoid this type of direct dependency. Instead of the car depending on a specific engine, it should depend on an abstraction or an interface that describes how an engine should work. This way, you can swap the engine whenever you want, as long as the new engine adheres to the same interface.
