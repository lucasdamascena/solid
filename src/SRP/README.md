## SRP (Single Responsability Principle)

The 'S' in SOLID refers to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This principle states that a class should have only one responsibility, meaning there should be only one reason for it to change. In other words, a class should focus on doing one well-defined and specific thing.
